Determine the records that are invalid:

select Responseduedate, * from cs.CPMrdoGrievances where ISDATE(Responseduedate) <> 1

Test out the values returned by performing the following:

DECLARE @A AS VARCHAR(25)

SET @A =  '2/29/1900'  -- Whatever date is returned, set @A value to that.
SELECT CONVERT(DATETIME,@A,120)
-- 2/29/1900
